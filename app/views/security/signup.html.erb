We are now using <A HREF="http://www.mygcx.org">The Key</A> 
(formally known as the Global ConneXion or GCX) to authenticate users.  
The Key is developed by the American Campus 
Crusade for Christ tech team, and is used by Campus Crusade ministries around the world.  <A HREF="http://technology.ccci.org/gcx/index.html">Read more about GCX here</A>.  Using GCX means more people can use the project tool, and you only need to remember one GCX login rather than separate credentials for each site.
